# Introduction

## Question(s) of interests

In the analysis I will be investigating questions related to the revenue and disney films Disney datasets.I will be exploring information related to movie revenue by voice actor. I am primarily interested in looking films that were made after 1999 because I believe that data will me more relavent to the present day film industry. I believe that acotors who on average gross more revenue per film will appear in more films since disney will be more interested in casting them.

## Dataset description 

The below descripitions were taken directly from the [website](https://www.kaggle.com/prateekmaj21/disney-movies) where the datasets were originally obtained.

"All Disney movies with their release dates, genre, rating, total gross and inflation adjusted gross(2016).
Disney has produced many movies, this data has all Disney movies till 2016."


The `Disney` dataset is composed of 5 tables `disney_movies_total_gross.csv`, `disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv`, `disney-characters.csv`, `disney-directors.csv`, `disney-voice-actors.csv`. Each table is stored as a `.csv` file.
